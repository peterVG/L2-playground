Hardware and software testing playground to determine minimum, cheapest compute requirements for running a L2 consensus network capable of: collecting, validating, publishing, and archiving data to the Cardano and Arweave blockchains.


-----

## Step 1
- Acquire cheap used compute: Playstation 3 (x5) (@archerfuse)
  - brick them to prepare for Linux OS install (@archerfuse)

## Step 2
- Acquire cheap new compute: Raspberry Pi v? (x5) (@peterVG)

## Step 3
- Determine which Linux version to use (@peterVG)

## Step 4
- Install same Linux version on Playstations and Pis (@archerfuse)

## Step 5
- Install [Logos Network](https://logos.co) 
- Demonstrate a Logos HelloWorld!
  * Logos is a fully decentralised, privacy-preserving, and politically neutral technology stack
  * Logos is composed of three primary protocols: Nomos, Codex, and Waku, for consensus, file storage, and communication respectively.
* Step 5.a Install a [Nomos node](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node) and connect to a local testnet
